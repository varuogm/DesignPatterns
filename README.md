# Singleton

### main intution 


> Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the new operator with the Singleton class.

> Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object

### pros and cons

lazy load -thread safety ka dhyan rakho . try make the black syncronised or lock until a single threads completes it exceution and then it will proceed accordingly.
eager - eargerly in the start free foket ka object ban jayega shared memory me ,usee hota rhaga ek hi instance.. but what if program me jarurrt hi nhi padi and aise 100 eager instances pade ho.. no not recomemnded..
